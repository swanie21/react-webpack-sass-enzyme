# React Boilerplate configured with Webpack, Sass and Enzyme

This boilerplate allows you to immediately start building your app without having to wire up testing and styling.

# To Use the Boilerplate

clone this [repo](https://github.com/swanie21/react-webpack-sass-enzyme.git)

To start the server:
```
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in the browser to view your app

To run the test suite:
```
npm test
```

The test suite includes a helper file that includes `babel` presets to transform ES6 to ES5. Now you can use Enzyme testing with ES6!

Sass is all wired up and ready to go! To make this happen these dependencies were installed:

```
npm install sass-loader style-loader css-loader node-sass --save-dev
```
